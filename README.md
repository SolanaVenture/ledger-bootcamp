# Bootcamp Ledger / Bootcamp Deposit-Refund System

A mini deposit-refund system for Encode Club that enables users to deposit 250 USDC from any platform and automatically receive a refund based on specific conditions.

## Features

- **Refund Condition:** Users are eligible for a refund if they meet a minimum 90% attendance requirement.
- **Authorization:** Authorized Encode Club accounts can approve refund requests.

## Components
**Smart Contract for Deposit and Refund**

Manages the logic for depositing USDC, tracks attendance, and processes refunds.

**Frontend Application**

Interfaces with the smart contract for users and staff. Allows users to deposit USDC, view their attendance, and check refund status. Authorized accounts can verify and approve refunds.

**Oracles or Integrations for Attendance Tracking**

Tracks and records attendance data, likely interfacing with the educational platform's backend. (Note: Oracles may be needed for this integration.)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node v18.18.0 or higher

- Rust v1.70.0 or higher
- Anchor CLI 0.29.0 or higher (we use 0.29.0 here)
- Solana CLI 1.17.0 or higher

### Development

1. Make sure you are at localnet, build the anchor program and deploy it:

```shell
cd anchor
anchor build
```

2. Open a termial:

```shell
solana-test-validator
```

3. Open a terminal:

```shell
solana logs
```

4. Open a terminal and run the web2 backend api server (make sure the environment of mongdb is ready):

```shell
cd web2-api
npm run dev
```

5. Open another terminal and run the react app (make sure at the root directory):

```shell
npm run dev
```

6.  open http://localhost:3000 and make sure you have installed the browser wallet plugin like Phantom, set it to the development and use the local network

## Apps

### anchor

This is a Solana program written in Rust using the Anchor framework.

#### Commands

You can use any normal anchor commands. Either move to the `anchor` directory and run the `anchor` command or prefix the command with `npm run`, eg: `npm run anchor`.

#### Sync the program id:

Running this command will create a new keypair in the `anchor/target/deploy` directory and save the address to the Anchor config file and update the `declare_id!` macro in the `./src/lib.rs` file of the program.

You will manually need to update the constant in `anchor/lib/basic-exports.ts` to match the new program id.

```shell
npm run anchor keys sync
```

#### Build the program:

```shell
npm run anchor-build
```

#### Start the test validator with the program deployed:

```shell
npm run anchor-localnet
```

#### Run the tests

```shell
npm run anchor-test
```

#### Deploy to Devnet

```shell
npm run anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
```

### ExpressJS Web2 backend

We use MongoDB as the backend database.

You can host MongoDB by yourself, or use the cloud solutions like [mongodb atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)

Create a `.env` file at the `web2-api` directory:

```
DB_PASSWORD=[DB_PASSWORD]
```

Modify the connection string at `web2-api/index.js` (**TODO**)

Then:

```shell
cd web2-api
npm run dev
```

Add the organizer:

```shell
cd web-api
npm run manage
```

### React App

This is a React app that uses the Anchor generated client to interact with the Solana program.

#### Commands

Start the web app

```shell
npm run dev
```

Build the web app

```shell
npm run build
```
